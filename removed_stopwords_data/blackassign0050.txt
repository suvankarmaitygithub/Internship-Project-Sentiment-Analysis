environmental impact covid-19 pandemic – lesson future covid- 19 pandemics forced factories shut down, flights canceled massive decrease global economy, significant decrease gases (ghg) developed developing countries. sars- cov2 spotlight 2019 impacted till then. 131 infected worldwide resulting deaths 2.9 world health organisation (who). dealt virus imposing strict lockdowns social distancing control spread virus. policies caused adverse effects worldwide. important impacts covid-19 pandemic environment. positive impacts environment due lockdown like, air pollution decreased dramatically, people asked stay houses due lockdowns. decline environmental noise. environmental noise defined unwanted harmful outdoor sounds caused human activities noise emitted road traffics, air traffics, rail traffics, industrial activities. important challenges modern noise pollution adverse effects humans harm animals too. imposition lockdown quarantine nation’s governments caused people remain homes. this, movement people reduced significantly personal public transport decreased. due changes, environmental noise generated dropped substantially. water pollution beaches reduced significantly animals spotted cities, covid-19 virus generated negative indirect effect environment. begin with, developed halted sustainability program pandemic. nation-states, waste recycling plants suspended municipalities due concern virus spread recycling centers. resulted increase single-use plastic bags re-usable bags leading restaurants, firms, corporations. instance, starbucks, leading company 2020, announced short-lived ban utilization recyclable reusable cups. furthermore, people staying indoors lockdown majority department stores, shops, restaurants, food outlets closed, making online purchase

inorganic wastes generated due policies crafted government takes heavy toll environment environmental issues water pollution, air pollution, soil erosion, harm local fauna. demand masks pandemic skyrocketing materials required production masks highly dangerous environment generally composed non-woven fabrics. polyester, polystyrene, polyethylene, polycarbonate, common materials surgical density lying 20grams 25 grams/sq. meter. materials resistant liquids plastic-based products afterlife discarded. treated properly discarding, end filling landfills oceans making dangerous aquatic lifeforms. example, recently environment started degrading drastically pandemic accumulation clinical wastes. recycling plants hold, piles mountains wastes depositions open areas formed due increasing number unrecycled wastes generated day. makes surrounding vulnerable creating risk air pollutions dumped open wastes decays methane (ch4), greenhouse gas, increasing risk global warming too. surroundings affected careless methods, local people affected. excess methane accumulated earth’s atmosphere due piles unrecycled wastes, result increases earth’s average temperature harmful future generations. protected endangered fauna facing greater risks due imposition lockdown. lockdown made people stay inside homes. employees, ngos, volunteers working protected areas national parks, conservation zones, wildlife sanctuaries made stay home making protected endangered fauna unattended. led increase illegal activities wildlife hunting, illegal deforestation, fishing activities due absence people. prohibition eco-tourism led significant financial drop economy protected areas. asked local authorities native government bodies increase amount disinfection routine, increase dosage chlorine wastewater treatment prevent spread covid-19 virus. however, (2020), solid evidence found survival virus lifespan virus wastewater drinking water. fact excessive amounts chlorine water harmful problems issues people’s health bladder cancer damages cells. covid-19 reminder health planet linked health humans. evidence proves virus zoonotic, meaning transmitted people animals. accountable seventy-five percent emerging infectious diseases world. virus infecting millions people globe, governments agencies’ top priority regulate spread virus shifting spotlight management treatment wastes (especially clinical medical waste). likewise, time, responsible individuals step follow guideline precautions disposal waste medical gears. spite data showing pollutions reduced significantly pandemic, history witnessed rise pollution “post-financial crisis”. similar observed 2008 financial crash – temporary decrease emissions 1.3% observed, economy recovered 2010, emissions all-time high. all, sheer mutual empathy goodwill world emerge stronger global pandemic. prevent future outbreaks, address regularly threats ecosystems wildlife, including habitat loss, illegal trade, pollution, climate change human life depends earth’s life. live spacious outdoor area, desert empty road lined trees realize it’s safe, surface-less space walk in, begin realize beauty nature. point remain indoors, avoid contact others. leave home, walk desert run street, make wipe surfaces contact with, avoid touching face, frequently wash hands. blackcoffer insights 27: saujanya roy, maritime
