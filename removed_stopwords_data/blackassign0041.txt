robo human impact future? it’s 2060. automaton research laboratory scientist, “warning! error occurred reformatting hard disk now!” scientist panics. automaton again,” ha! ha! kidding! “. funny right. joke isn’t realistic, “how automaton joke?” 2017, “sofia” robot made joke show morning britain! thought computers joke? hard believe? well, idea giving computers human-enjoy thinking reality. technological advancement decade. diving deep impact future work, let’s begin simple question: what’s ai? artificial intelligence machines data. machine patterns trends found data makes decision, create thought patterns trends. fig: impact robots employments rise ai, humans divided question. machines human’s foe? tech executives politicians conference stages, campaign rallies, science fiction movies carbon black, westworld, minority report, machina question. solve problems rise result destruction end world, know. hawking made secret concern rise superhuman eventually escape earth planet. no, isn’t plot mirror. now, superhumans reality, is. “homo deus”, emergence digital god ai. god worry, job. here’s career advice, thought robot?
