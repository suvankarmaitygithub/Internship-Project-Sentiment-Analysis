difference artificial intelligence , machine learning , statistics , data mining ? “ data oil ” important trendline 21st century . reason advancements data analysis . machine learning statistics data mining data developing staggering pace , popular buzzwords days . buzzwords originated technical terms underlying essence fashionable impress . reason misconception people . ai , ml , stats , data mining , analysis data mistook thing , words interchangeably convey thing . all ! similarity disciplines disciplines analysis data converting data “ information ” . academics , learning machine learning statistics data mining , academic approach wander technical definitions concepts underlying essence aim discipline remain unexplored , articles explain difference . thus , primary confusion learners . hence , article explains difference explaining philosophy aims disciplines wandering technical definitions . difference machine learning statistics data mining ? essential difference disciplines lies “ aims ” approach achieve aims . aims explained detail sections : artificial intelligence : aim artificial intelligence understand intelligent entities . satisfy aim , understand intelligence makes agent intelligent agent ? answer questions found studying intelligent agents intelligent agent found standing front mirror ! yes ! humans examples intelligent entities . thus , 1900s , researchers began exploring thought process , reasoning process humans human beings considered ideal intelligent agent . mimicking human behavior aim initial years research . setting goal , studies experiments began famous experiment conducted initial years achieve aim turing test ! turing defined intelligent behavior ability achieve human-level performance cognitive tasks , sufficient fool interrogator . test received criticism mimicking human behavior intelligence . intelligence working human human brain , intelligence meaning ! thus , mimicking human thought processes reasoning transformed aim . psychology philosophy resonate aim understand human thought process . difference understand thought process mimic it , build it . collaboration resulted models neural networks mimic function neurons present human brain . so , basically , initial aim human-centered humans considered ideal intelligent agent . concurrently , computer science developing greater pace . advances computer science , experiments theories easily tested validated . programs applied solve real-life problems , found computers performed humans tasks complex humans . examples chess-playing program . program defeated world ’ s chess kasparov . incident human intelligence ultimate intelligence human defeat program . leads question , human intelligence ideal intelligence ? computers advanced , proved humans complex tasks . definition intelligence ability solve cognitive tasks problems . so , nature agents , researchers began study nature intelligence itself . question test validate intelligence ? test intelligence solve cognitive problems . agent intelligent solve complex problem . problem-solving approach easily tested validated computers . thus , researchers began studying ideal intelligence , selected agent validate experiments computer . so , computer problem-solving approach adopted . so , human-centered approach computer , problem-solving approach aims ai . contributed giving valuable insights . aims important collaboratively form aim ai ! machine learning : problem-solving approach , big challenge overcome order achieve aim . solving math problem . cases intelligence tested problem-solving approach . math problems solve . problem familiar problem not . problem . problem familiar you , solve kind problems solved similar problems past . so , question , mind solve problem ? answer is , solved similar problems past , learned past data , solve problems , haven ’ t problem past , solve similar problems . form intelligence . problem solved kind problems past . solve problem , consciously gather manipulate information reach conclusion . kind approach necessarily rely past data completely reasoning process . kind intelligence . build intelligent agents , kinds intelligence developed agent . but , reality reached point build agents learn past data find information . today reached point build agents own . type intelligence . so , implement type intelligence machine learning ! so , domain focuses solely implementing kind intelligence fact machine learning . reason ml called subset ai ! so , difference ml . technically speaking , “ it study computers ability learn past data find meaningful conclusions , patterns explicitly programmed ” . statement elaboration . essence ml process “ generalization ” learning past data . generalization abstraction common properties specific instances formulated general concepts claims . humans recognize life objects . animal , easily recognize “ dog ” “ cat ” . trivial task wondered mind it ? answer generalization ! picture dog , easily recognize picture dog , because , minds abstracted description dog formulated “ concept ” dog concepts learned past experiences dog . so , dependent fact things represented generalized concepts minds . generalization only , “ information ” . so , give computers ability generalize “ raw data ” convert “ information ” patterns trends data own . statistics : discipline concerns collection , organization , analysis , interpretation , presentation data . statistics data aim explain it . so , study explaining data itself ! statistics domains descriptive statistics inferential statistics . descriptive statistics deals explanation description data “ descriptive ” statistics . explain information possible , easily data complex task otherwise . inferential statistics make accurate inferences data . inference tasks lives . simple cooking soup . completing recipe , taste sample , is , spoonful soup check soup tastes bad . depending result sample , make inference soup soup whole , bad . similarly , statistics , cases apply inference meaningful information . example , gather data time-consuming costly . cases , applying inference based introduces uncertainty . inferential statistics help . so , data context uncertainty decision-making face uncertainty statistics deals with . so , however , data , statistics explain data . aim resonate ml , statistics correctly interpret data ! data mining : “ data ” , raw form . examples sensors industrial applications . sensors manufacturing sense properties temperature , pressure , etc . raw data generated sensors converted suitable form , processed , analyzed gather valuable insights , solve problem ! due unique aim capturing essence datasets , gather insights , data mining referred “ knowledge discovery ” . why , fiorina , ceo hewlett-packard said , “ the goal turn data information information insight ” . statement completely explains aim data mining ! so , difference machine learning statistics data mining lies aims . approaches fields , fulfilling aims fields . beauty fields ! blackcoffer insights 25 : abhishek govekar , vishwakarma institute technology , pune , india .
